\section{Conclusion}



% Markus part

In the simulation study we demonstrated the effect of various prior distributions on the estimation of hierachical models. 
We have shown that wrong prior distributions pushes the posterior in the wrong direction, while providing guidance in the estimation of parameters. On the other hand, a uniform prior does increase the variability in the model estimates. 
We conclude that it is a good strategy to use weak prior distributions even when one is uniformed about the true parameter values. Weak priors will improve the fit of your model when working with small sample sizes even if they are distributed around a wrong center.
Further we find that the random slope model with group characteristics uses large sample sizes to come up with stable estimates of the group model coefficient.Therefore we use a simple model in the following application of the bayesian model.

In the simulation study, we demonstrated the effect of various prior distributions on the estimation of hierarchical models. 
We have shown that wrong prior distribution pulls the posterior in its direction. However, the prior also guide the estimation of parameters. A uniform prior does increase the variability in the model estimates. \\

We conclude that it is a good strategy to use weak prior distributions, even when one is uninformed about the actual parameter values. Weak priors will improve the fit of your model when working with small sample sizes, also if they are wrong centered.
Further, we find that the random slope model with group characteristics requires large sample sizes to come up with stable estimates of the group model coefficient. Therefore we use a simple model in the following application of the Bayesian model.
